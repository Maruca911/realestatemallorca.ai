  { id: 63, category: 'Short-Term Rentals', question: 'Can I rent in Mallorca for 2-11 months without a long-term contract?', answer: 'Yes. Medium-term rentals (2-11 months) are a growing market in Mallorca. They do not require an ETV tourist license and fall under Spain\'s seasonal use rental law (uso distinto de vivienda). Expect to pay 30-50% less than equivalent nightly holiday rates. Properties are often fully furnished with utilities included. Platforms like Idealista, Spotahome, and Flatio specialize in this segment.' },
  { id: 64, category: 'Short-Term Rentals', question: 'Are utilities included in Mallorca short-term rental prices?', answer: 'For holiday rentals under 1 month, utilities (electricity, water, Wi-Fi) are almost always included in the nightly rate.

  { id: 65, category: 'Short-Term Rentals', question: 'What are my rights as a tenant in a short-term rental in Mallorca?', answer: 'For holiday rentals booked through platforms, you are protected by the platform\'s policies (refunds for inaccurate listings, safety issues).

Disputes can be resolved through the Mallorca Consumer Protection Office (OMIC).' },
  { id: 66, category: 'Short-Term Rentals', question: 'How do I avoid rental scams when booking in Mallorca?', answer: 'Book through established platforms (Airbnb, Booking.com) for payment protection. Verify ETV license numbers on the Balearic government tourism registry. Never wire money to personal accounts. Red flags include prices far below market rate, pressure to pay quickly, and refusal to video-call or provide a verifiable address. If in doubt, contact a local rental agency directly.' },
  { id: 67, category: 'Short-Term Rentals', question: 'What is the best time of year to rent in Mallorca for the best price?', answer: 'December through March offers the lowest rates (40-60% below peak). Shoulder seasons (April-May, October-November) offer great weather at 30-40% below peak prices. July-August is the most expensive and should be booked 3-6 months ahead. For medium-term stays, negotiating a winter contract (October-April) often yields the best monthly rates.' },
  { id: 68, category: 'Costs & Taxes', question: 'What tax do I pay on rental income in Mallorca as a non-resident?', answer: 'EU/EEA non-residents pay 19% tax on net rental income (gross income minus allowable deductions such as property management, repairs, IBI, and insurance). Non-EU non-residents pay 24% on gross rental income with limited deductions. All non-residents must also file an annual imputed income tax return for periods the property is not rented. Consult a Spanish tax advisor (gestoria) for compliance.' },
  { id: 69, category: 'Investment', question: 'Is a new-build or resale property a better investment in Mallorca?', answer: 'New builds offer modern energy efficiency, 10-year structural warranties, staged payments, and lower initial maintenance costs. However, they carry 10% VAT versus 8-11.5% ITP for resale, and completion delays are possible. Resale properties offer negotiation room, established communities, and often better locations. For rental income, an ETV-licensed resale property may generate faster returns than a new build still under construction.' },
  { id: 70, category: 'Investment', question: 'What are the best areas in Mallorca for rental investment in 2026?', answer: 'Palma (year-round demand, highest occupancy), Alcudia (longest beach season, family market), Pollensa (premium nightly rates, affluent clientele), and Soller (growing popularity, Tramuntana appeal) offer the strongest rental fundamentals. For capital appreciation, the southwest coast (Andratx, Calvia) and Palma\'s Old Town/Santa Catalina lead. Always verify ETV license availability in your target area before purchasing.' },
